h2. Recent Projects

h3. Survey Engine %(right light)Winter 2007 - Winter 2010%

A web application I developed for "New Amsterdam Consulting, Inc.":http://newamsterdamconsulting.com/ that serves as a platform for large data collection and reporting initiatives. The platform is currently being used to power the "Council of Juvenile Correctional Administrators'":http://cjca.net/ Performance-based Standards, Community-based Standards and Yearbook projects.

The application is built to run on Windows using ASP.NET, with Microsoft SQL Server as the primary data store. The main architectural components include a survey building, versioning and distribution system, and a point-and-click reporting system. The application is currently used to deploy and report on surveys of up to hundreds of questions long distributed to thousands of users, collecting and analyzing millions of data points.

I began the project in 2007 and have been the primary developer ever since, with light support from colleagues during maintenance or new feature releases.
